    Purpose
  </p>
  <p class="inst-des">
    These Skills and Experience maps outline the diverse opportunities available to build skills and undertake experiences during your career journey with EY. They are designed to facilitate your selection of relevant development preferences, by Transformative leadership pillar and behavior , experience or skill to achieve your aspirations and drive your individual career journey in the direction you choose.	
  <p class="inst-hd">
    When and how to use the Maps 
  </p>
  <p class="inst-des">
    The Skills and Experience maps should be used during regular career conversations between counselee and counselor. 
Each map has been developed to reflect the variety of experiences that are encountered during your core Audit career journey. They have been tailored to reflect the rank expectations for Audit, and are aligned to the Transformative Leadership model. There is a map for each rank from staff to senior manager. Individuals who aspire to accelerate their career progression should reference the Skills and Experience map of both their current rank and that of the rank above.
